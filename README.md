## 📈 Stock Price Prediction - Minor Project  

🚀 This project predicts stock prices using **historical data** and a trained **Deep Learning (LSTM) model**.  
    It is implemented with **Streamlit** to provide an interactive and user-friendly web interface.  

🔗 **Live Demo**: Coming soon! 🚧


### 📖 About the Project  

- 📊 Uses **historical stock data** (Yahoo Finance API)  
- 📉 Implements **Moving Averages (50, 100, 200 days)** for stock trend visualization  
- 🤖 Predicts **future stock prices** using a trained **LSTM model**  
- 📈 Provides **interactive charts and visualizations** with Matplotlib + Streamlit  

✨ This project was created as part of my **Minor Project** during my IT engineering journey.
